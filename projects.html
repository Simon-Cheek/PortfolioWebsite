        Airship: for Woodwind Quintet (pre. April 2024)
      </p>

      <p class="gen-text">
        'Airship' is a 5 minute concert opener for Woodwind Quintet that is inspired from the unique role that the
        French Horn plays within the quintet.
        Many composers approach the instrument differently, often requiring the horn to play quietly. I wanted to give
        the horn an oppurtunity to do the opposite.
        I think of the wind quintet as a texture often resembling the sky- nimble and expansive. I thought of the French
        Horn as a sort of airship, flying through an
        atmospheric texture created by the other instruments. 'Airship' is dynamic, expressive, and an exciting way to
        open a recital!

        A Garden: Song cycle for Soprano, Cello, and Piano (prem. April 2024)
      </p>

      <p class="gen-text">
        This song cycle is the result of a collaboration between myself and a poet, Alanna Hess. The poem uses a garden
        as a metaphor
        for sharing thoughts with the world- it's a journey from negative self talk and comparison to acceptance and
        humility.
        The cycle is set in 5 movements: 3 songs with an instrumental interlude between each.

          Balm of Gilead: A Musical Essay on Sorrow and Joy
        </p>

        <p class="gen-text">
          'Balm of Gilead', a long awaited projet of mine, is the culminating composition of my undergraduate music
          composition career. The work is
          anticipated to be between 10-15 minutes in length and dwells on many of my core principles as it relates to
          music. I write to find joy in
          all of the world around us. I find that to be impossible without acknowledging the darker moments of our
          existence- as they are what shape
          us and allow us to feel joy. I write to point people to that joy- not by pretending there are no difficulties
          in life, but by finding beauty in
          them. The term 'Balm of Gilead' was used in the Old Testament as a metaphor for relief from suffering. This
          piece depicts that relief- a relief
          that comes gradually through persistence and determination, as we often experience in our lives.
