            The Screamer: for Solo Viola (prem. Dec 2023)
          </p>

          <p class="gen-text">
            'The Screamer' is the result of my first collaboration with my wife (a violist). The title is inspired from a viola that she 
            came across at a festival, named 'The Screamer'. The viola was larger than normal (16.5 inches) and it projected incredibly 
            well! Now that my wife has a viola of the same size (and similar strengths), I knew I had to do this name justice! 
            What makes the viola special is its C string, which projects with 
            incredible volume and roundness of sound. Works by Bartok and Hindemith shine especially on this viola when it dips into the lower 
            register, which gave me the idea for this piece- a piece which is dedicated to the C string. The piece alternates between episodes 
            of relative stability and episodes that are dark and furious, using the C string to bring out an aggressive and virtuosic side 
            of the viola.

            A Garden: Song cycle for Soprano, Cello, and Piano (prem. April 2024)
          </p>

          <p class="gen-text">
            This song cycle is the result of a collaboration between myself and a poet, Alanna Hess. The poem uses a garden as a metaphor 
            for sharing thoughts with the world- it's a journey from negative self talk and comparison to acceptance and humility. 
            The cycle is set in 5 movements: 3 songs with an instrumental interlude between each.

              Balm of Gilead: A Musical Essay on Sorrow and Joy
            </p>
  
            <p class="gen-text">
              'Balm of Gilead', a long awaited projet of mine, is the culminating composition of my undergraduate music composition career. The work is
              anticipated to be between 10-15 minutes in length and dwells on many of my core principles as it relates to music. I write to find joy in 
              all of the world around us. I find that to be impossible without acknowledging the darker moments of our existence- as they are what shape
              us and allow us to feel joy. I write to point people to that joy- not by pretending there are no difficulties in life, but by finding beauty in 
              them. The term 'Balm of Gilead' was used in the Old Testament as a metaphor for relief from suffering. This piece depicts that relief- a relief
              that comes gradually through persistence and determination, as we often experience in our lives.
