            Pulsating: Duets for Eb Clarinet and Contrabassoon (prem. Nov 2023)
          </p>

          <p class="gen-text">
            Perhaps the two least alike woodwind instruments, the Eb Clarinet and the contrabassoon are rarely 
            put together. 'Pulsating' seeks to unite these two instruments in a way that complements the 
            pairing as well as brings out their differences. Repeated motifs and figures create a 
            sound environment of humor and lightheartedness while also evoking a subtle melancholy mood. Steady rhythms 
            and use of silence creates an almost ethereal setting that brings respect as well as appreciation for the odd pairing. 
            The piece will be in two movements, about 5 minutes in total.

            The Screamer: for Solo Viola (prem. Nov 2023)
          </p>

          <p class="gen-text">
            'The Screamer' is the result of my first collaboration with my wife (a violist). Her viola was given the title "Screamer"
            by its maker for being a larger than usual viola (16.5 inches). What makes it special is the C string, which projects with 
            incredible volume and roundness of sound. Works by Bartok and Hindemith shine especially on this viola when it dips into the lower 
            register, which gave me the idea for this piece- a piece which is dedicated to the C string. The piece alternates between episodes 
            of relative stability and episodes that are dark and furious, using the C string to bring out an aggressive and virtuosic side 
            of the viola.

            A Garden: Song cycle for Soprano, Cello, and Piano (prem. April 2024)
          </p>

          <p class="gen-text">
            This song cycle is the result of a collaboration between myself and a poet, Alanna Hess. The poem uses a garden as a metaphor 
            for sharing thoughts with the world- it's a journey from negative self talk and comparison to acceptance and humility. 
            The cycle is set in 5 movements: 3 songs with an instrumental interlude between each.
