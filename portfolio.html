            'Swarm' for String Quartet comes from a fascination in natural sounds. More specifically, that of bugs. 
            When I was walking through the forests in North Carolina, I noticed that the hum of bugs throughout the forest 
            felt like a constant wave of sound- something that transformed when I listened in specifically to a specific insect.
            This gave me the idea of this piece- a piece where skittish and rapid fragments of music combine to form 
            a 'humming' sound, one that represents a swarm of bugs. As the piece continues, these sounds evolve into individual sounds, as well 
            as more carefully organized bits that spawn from the original material.

            The concept for 'I Dream of Mists' also comes from my time in North Carolina. I was feeling an incredible amount of
            stress leading into future graduate school auditions. I felt pressure to write music that could be deemed 'impressive' or
            virtuosic for the sake of acceptance from academic circles. When I came to Brevard, all of those sentiments and pent up stress quickly vanished. I would spend hours sitting by the lake, watching fish swim by and geese explore.
            The world moved so much slowly than when I was busy at work and it washed away all of my anxieties. I decided to write a piece that would
            depict my evenings, laying down in front of the lake and watching clouds pass by over my head. Some would be foggy mists, and some would be
            large thunderheads. Regardless of energy (or lack thereof), those clouds conveyed peace and comfort. This piece seeks to capture that in music- floating 
            textures and forms weave in and out with each other, creating energy and excitement whilst never losing its amicable state of being.

            Written for a mixed combo (Flute, Bb Clarinet, Violin, Cello, and Piano), 'The Ostrich' is a vivid depiction of nature and 
            its interaction with human civilization. I felt frustrated that the forests I grew up in had disappeared and been replaced by tightly 
            compact townhomes. This piece draws upon natural sounds I grew up with, as well as chaos that comes as humans impact these environments. 
            The title comes from a metaphor associated with the ostrich, which is hiding one's head in the sand to avoid predators. More peaceful and vibrant
            moments deteriorate into pure chaos as environmental problems are left unchecked. At the end, a final eulogy mourns the loss of the forests.

            'Chains in the Mirror' depicts an orchestral journey of self identity and acceptance. The main idea originates from a discussion I had with
            some colleagues about putting one's identity in music. I found that I was often trying to hide from myself in my music and write things that
            were devoid of personality. I treated this piece as a journey from denying to eventually accepting one's self. A quiet, introspective
            episode is bookended by outcries of violence and anxiety. Every section of the orchestra clashes with each other to convey intense inner turmoil
            until a final arrival and brass fanfare symbolizes a resolute and firm acceptance of identity.

            Written for Oboe, Bb Clarinet, and Bassoon, this piece depicts turmoil and struggle that come from all sorts of difficulties we face
            in life. It shows a lifelong journey of rising above the hardships that all of us encounter. The title comes from a quote in the Book 
            of Mormon, a religious piece of literature associated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Each combination of 2 instruments 
            are featured in duets that evolve from violent and mournful to hopeful and almost otherworldly.

            This flute sonata is set in 3 movements, each depicting a different stage of a hike in the mountains. Having grown up on the east coast of 
            the US, I was surprised to experience a drastic change in scenery upon moving to Utah. This piece depicts excitement, introspection, and awe 
            that can be all experienced when hiking. Driving melodies, cadenza like moments, and rhythmic interplay all combine to create an emotional journey
            through the peaks of the Wasatch range in Utah!

            A single movement clarinet concerto, this piece depicts grief and pain. Feelings of longing and mourning turn to desperation and eventually
            anger. This piece explores the negative consequences of internalizing emotions and refusing to confide or express them in healthy ways.
            Lush string melodies and counterlines breathe life and melancholy until violent episodes of brass and percussion take over. The solo clarinet
            features a balance of soaring melodies and rapid passages that showcase the versatility and expressive range of the instrument.

            Inspired by a sculpture in the Springville Museum of Art (Springville, Utah), this piece explores the concept of eternity and the endless 
            flow of time. The piece moves slowly with a puslating ostinato that rarely ceases. The piece marches on, seemingly unaffected by the flow of time.
            A mental journey occurs throughout, of someone desperate to bend time or escape- an attempt that grows in intensity throughout but remains futile. 
            While somber in message, the piece has an affable quality to it. The flow of time, while unrelenting, seems to possess an etheral and almost friendly
            quality- it is soothing. The premiere of this piece occured in the same museum in which the piece was inspired.
