            Swarm: for String Quartet (July 2023) <br> 6' <br>

            'Swarm' for String Quartet comes from a fascination in natural sounds. More specifically, that of bugs. 
            When I was walking through the forests in North Carolina, I noticed that the hum of bugs throughout the forest 
            felt like a constant wave of sound- something that transformed when I listened in specifically to a specific insect.
            This gave me the idea of this piece- a piece where skittish and rapid fragments of music combine to form 
            a 'humming' sound, one that represents a swarm of bugs. As the piece continues, these sounds evolve into individual sounds, as well 
            as more carefully organized bits that spawn from the original material.
