                Airship (Woodwind Quintet) - 5 Minutes
            </p>

            <p class="gen-text">
                Airship is a concert opener dedicated to the excitement and the variety that comes with a woodwind
                quintet. The piece features the french horn in particular,
                giving the horn a chance to shine (and sometimes quite loudly). Aleatoric elements combined with thick
                textures makes for a foggy yet dynamic opener to the recital!
            </p> <br>

            <p class="gen-h">Pressed (Solo Viola) - 3 Minutes</p>

            <p class="gen-text">
                Pressed is a work for solo viola that stands as an expression of desperation. The piece is full of
                turmoil and anxiety as the viola's sound takes on a more ferocious tone than usual. A somber yet
                strained middle section hints at a pained personality seeking relief desperately.

            <p class="gen-h">Dusk Descending upon Glass (Solo Violin) - 5 Minutes</p>

            <p class="gen-text">
                Dusk Descending upon Glass is a playful solo work inspired by the Bonneville Salt Flats. In the right
                conditions, shallow water makes for a perfectly reflected ground that mirrors the sky, giving the
                illusion of walking on clouds. When combined with the flat terrain for miles, a scene full of nothing by
                sky and high reaching mountains creates an elegance that is nearly unmatched in the world. I imagine
                someone alone on the flats, seemingly dancing on the sky as the sun slowly begins to set. A
                hollow-ness to the piece suggets a scene with nothing for miles, but also a jubilance that matches the
                noon-day slowly approaching the nightfall.

            <p class="gen-h">Pulsating (Eb Clarinet and Contrabassoon) - 6 Minutes</p>

            <p class="gen-h">Movement II</p>

            <p class="gen-text">Pulsating is a dynamic yet eerie work featuring a rather odd combination of instruments.
                The mix of a toy-sounding Eb Clarinet with an instrument often compared to a foghorn undoubtedly breeds
                some humor. The light-hearted temper of the piece fades rather quickly into a more somber section, one
                full of repeated rhythms. The constant pulse of notes suggests a faint flicker of lights in an otherwise
                dark and dreary night.

            <p class="gen-h">Sonata of the Heights (Flute and Piano) - 12 Minutes</p>

            <p class="gen-h">Movements I (Ascent), II (Summit), and III (Descent)</p>

            <p class="gen-text">
                The excitement of this piece dates back to my sophomore year, when the mountains were newer to me. I
                loved watching the mountains dominate the horizon with a red-filled glow in the sunset and majestic
                snow-filled peaks in the Winter. Each movement of the sonata depicts a verious stage of a hiking trip
                through the mountains. The flute is bright, excited, and joyful and the piano is strong, firm, and
                passive. The second movement features a more intimate moment with nature, featuring extended solos for
                each individual instrument.

            <p class="gen-text">Perhaps my most mature piece to date, A Garden stems from a collaboration with a friend
                of mine, Alanna Hess. Her text, shown below, follows 3 different poems in an journey of self-realization
                and confidence. A garden is used as a metaphor for self expression and ideas, one that the narrator
                struggles to express. Through episodes of self doubt, pity, and even anger comes a humility and
                confidence expressed through the final words of the cycle: "Dare to let my thoughts sprinkle out into
                the world, even if they don't grow." Each song is seperated by instrumental interludes, one for cello
                and piano, and one for solo cello.</p> <br>

            <p class="gen-h">I.</p>

            <p class="gen-text" style="text-indent: 0px;">You speak words in rows <br>
                pastel flowers, pink and cream, <br>
                clip them for strangers to smell <br>
                and feel your feelings on their cheeks <br> <br>

                I grow buds <br>
                that never blossom <br>
                thorns I cannot trim away <br>
                pricking blood <br>
                I do not plant those seeds again <br> <br>

                Bury, bury, bury them <br>
            </p>

            <p class="gen-h">II.</p>

            <p class="gen-text" style="text-indent: 0px;">
                You say cultivation <br>
                just takes a little education, <br> <br>

                but where did you learn <br>
                to plant words people want to <br>
                pick up and smell and touch and listen <br>
                and listen <br>
                and listen <br>
                to you? <br> <br>

                Winter freezes every growth <br>
                my thoughts wilt <br>
                feelings wither <br> <br>

                and no one visits an empty garden <br>
            </p>

            <p class="gen-h">III.</p>

            <p class="gen-text" style="text-indent: 0px;">
                Once I wove an entire lily <br>
                of words <br>
                you took it home in a purple vase <br>
                its fragrance a lucky haze <br>
                fading over days <br> <br>

                I never grew another <br>
                kept all these seeds inside me <br>
                to die in the darkness <br> <br>

                I’m tangled roots and dried stems <br>
                put me back together if you can <br>
                show me what it means to try again <br> <br>

                Dare to let my thoughts sprinkle out <br>
                into the world <br>
                even if they don’t grow <br>
            </p>
