              As a music major, my involvement in BYU started by performing as a clarinetist in every ensemble imagineable. Performing ensembles
              include the Marching Band, Wind Symphony, Philharmonic Orchestra, Group for New Music, and various chamber ensembles such as a woodwind quintet.
              As a composer, I have helped organize numerous composition recitals within the school of music as well as collaborated with many musicians ranging from
              soloists to the Philharmonic Orchestra.
              My desire to explore administrative oppurtunities within music led me to join the Student Advisory Council in 2023, where I 
              coordinate events such as recitals and advocate for student needs within the school. Upon adding a Computer Science minor in Summer of 
              2023, I joined the BYU Developer's Club, where we study Website and App development while networking with industry professionals and working on 
              personal and group projects.

              BYU School of Music Web Developer (November 2023 - Present):

            <p class="gen-text">
              My interests in both music and computer science led to a perfect oppurtunity once the School of Music announced an opening for a Web Developer. 
              My familiarity with the organization made the position ideal as duties have included maintaining and updating the Music website to reflect recent 
              events, changes, and information. The website is maintained using the Brightspot CMS and my work mainly involves front end development and UI/UX.
              In addition to updating webpages, I design new ones and integrate them into the system. I also work with a team which oversees School of Music advertising 
              and outreach, and help assist them in their online presence and other needs. Some back-end work is occasionally involved using PHP.

            <p class="gen-text">
              My TA work spans multiple classes and roles- the first of which was at the Music Tech Lab, where I helped students use and learn
              music software including Finale, Sibelius, Logic Pro, and Pro Tools. As a TA for classes such as Music Civilization, Theory, Form and Analysis, 
               and Orchestration, I frequently tutored students, graded essays and assignments, and helped with class administration and organization of events 
               such as music reading sessions.

            <p class="gen-text">
              Collaborations with musicians involving commissions have led to performances in a variety of venues, including the International
              Clarinet Festival's ClarinetFest, the Navy Band Saxophone Symposium, and the North American Saxophone Alliance. Educational oppurtunities
              have led to performances at the Georgia Music Educator's Association's Annual Conference, June in Buffalo New Music Festival, and the Brevard
              Music Center. While at BYU, I have worked as a copyist for numerous professors as well as groups and musicians outside of BYU.

              While not normally featured on resumes, this job contains a one of the feats I am most proud of in my professional career.
              I worked the morning shift, which started at 4am or 5am each weekday. I worked on and off between 2020 and 2023 for about a year and 
              a half in total, and during then, I never once slept through or missed a shift. While I have called in sick before (always at least a day in advance),
              I did take pride in showing up to every shift. I care about every job I perform regardless of glamour and will be the very best I can be 
              in any situation.
